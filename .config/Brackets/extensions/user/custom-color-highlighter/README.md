Brackets [CSS - Color Marker]
-----

A versatile color marker for CSS created to help designers/developers view assigned color values without leaving the text-editor or hover insist.  
Shout out to [Alexnder Taratin](https://github.com/QW0101/Brackets-Color-Highlighter) for creating the awesome Brackets color highlighter.

### Features

Please see the list of below mentioned features list:

* Auto-capitalization of colors and `Hex` values once declared
* Decent looking color badges with respective assigned color background. 

I'm currently working on bringing support for `SASS`, `LESS` & `rgb values` so stay tuned for more.  
Feel free to submit your feedback or suggestions.
